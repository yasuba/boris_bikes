#Boris Bikes

This is the first project set for me by Makers Academy. The goal of this project is to learn about object oriented programming, to practising TDD with RSpec and to write tests using doubles.

We have been challenged to write a simple system that manages the Boris Bike hire scheme, allowing a user to hire a bike, for the bike to be tracked by the system and be docked at a docking station. The bike should be working, but can be broken by a person after they hire it, they will then return the broken bike to the docking station. After this, the bike must be collected by a van to be taken to a garage where the bike will be fixed. The van will then return the bike to a docking station, ready to be hired again.
